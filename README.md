Features, Insights & Business Solutions
1️⃣ High Churn in Month-to-Month Contracts

Data Insight

Customers on month-to-month contracts account for ~55–60% of total churn

Churn rate for month-to-month customers is 2× higher than one-year or two-year contracts

Business Problem
Lack of commitment and frequent price comparison increases churn risk.

Proposed Solution

Introduce incentivized long-term contracts (6–12 month lock-in)

Offer price protection or bundled discounts at conversion points

Expected Impact

Even a 10% migration from month-to-month to annual contracts can reduce overall churn by 5–7%

Improves customer lifetime value (CLV)

2️⃣ Early-Tenure Customers Show Highest Attrition

Data Insight

Customers with tenure < 6 months contribute ~45% of churn

Churn sharply declines after the first year

Business Problem
Poor onboarding and early service dissatisfaction lead to early exits.

Proposed Solution

Structured first-90-day onboarding program

Proactive engagement: service walkthroughs, usage nudges, support calls

Expected Impact

Reducing early churn by 15–20% can significantly stabilize the customer base

Lower acquisition cost waste

3️⃣ Lack of Value-Added Services Increases Churn

Data Insight

Customers without Online Security / Tech Support show ~20–25% higher churn

Customers with bundled services stay longer on average

Business Problem
Customers perceive low value for money when only basic services are used.

Proposed Solution

Introduce bundled service packs at discounted entry pricing

Free trials for add-on services during onboarding

Expected Impact

Bundling can reduce churn by 8–12% in mid-risk segments

Increases ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

4️⃣ Electronic Check Payment Method Has Higher Churn

Data Insight

Customers using electronic check payments show ~18–20% higher churn

Auto-pay users are more stable and retained longer

Business Problem
Manual payment friction and failed payments increase dissatisfaction.

Proposed Solution

Incentivize auto-debit / card payments

Cashback or bill discounts for auto-pay adoption

Expected Impact

Auto-pay adoption can reduce churn by 5–8%

Improves billing efficiency and cash flow predictability

5️⃣ Higher Monthly Charges Correlate with Churn

Data Insight

Customers with higher monthly charges churn more, especially without bundled benefits

Price sensitivity is higher among short-tenure customers

Business Problem
Customers do not perceive sufficient value for higher pricing.

Proposed Solution

Tiered pricing with visible value differentiation

Personalized retention offers for high-bill customers

Expected Impact

Targeted discounts can retain high-revenue customers

Protects top-line revenue while controlling discount leakage
